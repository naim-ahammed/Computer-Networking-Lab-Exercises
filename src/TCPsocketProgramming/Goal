8 Lab Exercise (Submit as a report):

        Mathematical operations are very useful to be implemented using TCP socket programming. Create two
        processes, a server and a client using JAVA codes. The client will send two separate integer values and a
        mathematical operator to the server. The server receives these integers and a mathematical operator, then
        performs a mathematical operation based on the user input. The server then sends this answer to the client,
        who then displays it. The client sends requests as many times as he wishes. However, The server can serve at
        most 5 clients in its lifetime. The individual client ends its connection by saying “ENDS”. For example:
        • If the client sends 10, 20, and Sum, the server sends 30 to the client.
        • If the client sends 20, 5, and Subtract, the server sends 15 to the client.
        • If the client sends 20, 5, and Multiplication, the server sends 100 to the client.
        • If the client sends 20, 5, and Division, the server sends 4 to the client.
        • If the client sends 16, 3, and Modules, the server sends 1 to the client.
